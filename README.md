# Getting Started
We all love to hear music, sometimes move our body with the rhythm of it .<br/>
**Rhythm and dance** are deeply linked in history and practice.

_Tāṇḍavam_ is a divine dance performed by the god Shiv. Shiv's Tandav is described as a vigorous dance that is the source of the cycle of _creation, preservation_ and _dissolution_.
<br/>
Shivalay scene presents the dance forms of Lord Shiv and Its significance. <br/>

While the _Rudra Tandava_ depicts his violent nature, first as the creator and later as the destroyer of the universe, even of death itself, the _Ananda Tandava_ depicts him as joyful. In Shaiva Siddhanta tradition, Shiva as _Nataraja_ (lit. "Lord of dance") is considered the supreme lord of dance.
